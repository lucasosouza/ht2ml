# Hierarchical Temporal Memory 2 Machine Learning Project

Random experiments combining HTM or HTM inspired algorithms and machine learning.

Disclaimer: This is not a Numenta's official project. It is neither an accurate representation or an efficient implementation of HTM or any other algorithm depicted. These are variations around the theme mainly for learning and research purposes.
