# Hierarchical Temporal Memory 2 Machine Learning Project

Random experimentations of combining HTM inspired algorithms and machine learning.

Disclaimer: This is not a Numenta official project. It is not supposed to be neither an accurate representation or an efficient implementation of HTM or any other algorithm depicted. These are variations around the theme mainly for learning and research purposes.
